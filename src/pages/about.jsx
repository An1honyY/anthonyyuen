                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>I'm a fresh job seeker with an academic background in ICT.</p>
                <p>Roles I'd be best fit for are Helpdesk Support and Junior Software Developer.</p> 
                <br></br>
                <p>I'm looking for a full-time entry-level job.</p> 
                <p>I'm also interested in other part-time work in the meantime.</p>
                <br></br>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>I attended Auckland University of Technology.</p>
                <p>There, I gained a solid tech foundation from my Bachelors of Computer and Information Sciences in Digital Services and Software Development.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>I gained experience in Game, IoT and Web development, using languages such as Java, C#, Python, PHP and React.js. </p>
                <p>I was also given the chance to learn concepts such as the ITIL framework for services, needs analysis and security management.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p>My studies involved various team-based projects to give me practical soft skills - Problem Solving, Communication and Teamwork.</p>
                <p>Job experience includes part-time gardening and violin tutoring, which have built up my tenacity and people patience.</p>

                <br></br>
                <p>At the moment I'm practising Web development.</p>
                <p>My current project is a Mini Essay web app to encourage better learning using the Feynman technique.</p>
                <p>(That's where you learn through teaching. In this case, through a short typed format)</p>
